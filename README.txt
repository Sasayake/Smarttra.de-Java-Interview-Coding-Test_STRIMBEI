README

I/ Import the sources from Github in a new java project

II/ TEST 1
- this is a java program that shows the use of inheritance.
- run Test1 from coding_test_1 package
- follow the console instructions

III/ TEST 2
- this is a java program in which you can add elements to an array and than loop through the list and print the elements out in an ascending order.
- run Test2 from coding_test_2 package
- follow the console instructions

IV/ TEST 3
- this is a java program in which you add key values to a hashmap and than iterate over the hashmap to get the highest value and the lowest value from the hashmap.
- run Test3 from coding_test_3 package
- follow the console instructions

V/ TEST 4
- Create a Java program in which you add key values (same table above) to a hashmap and than provide the name of the stock (input on console) and give the value (price)
  of the stock as output on console
- run Test4 from coding_test_4 package
- follow the console instructions

/!\ When you input a value make sure to write a coma before the decimals
/!\ When you input a stock name, pay attention to capital letters

VI/ THEORY QUESTIONS : here are my answers
*The difference between Scala and Java is that it is not the same language even if both run on the JVM. Java is a fully object oriented language whereas Scala is a 
 functional and scripting oriented language which is also more concise.
 With Scala, type is not necessarily specified.
 
*The difference between ArrayList and HashMap is that HashMap uses key-value couples in order to find elements way more efficiently than ArrayList. However it is harder 
to work with a big HashMap than a big ArrayList as HashMap contains more data. Moreover ArrayList can be sorted but HashMap can't.
